# 📝 Learning, Deploying, Breaking, Fixing — A Pretty Normal Week

Over the past few days I’ve been bouncing between learning new tools, deploying security technologies, and trying not to break anything too badly in the process. Pretty standard week, really.

## 💻 Getting to grips with GitHub
I’ve finally spent some proper time learning GitHub — not just committing the odd script, but actually building out my profile, setting up GitHub Pages, and getting familiar with how everything ties together.
There’s something strangely satisfying about seeing it all click into place.

## 🔒 App Control for Business: the boss fight of security
A big chunk of my week has been spent working on App Control for Business.
If you know, you know.
Creating base and supplemental policies, testing them, retesting them, then wondering why something that should be allowed still decides to throw a tantrum… it’s all part of the fun.
But there’s something rewarding about seeing a clean, controlled application landscape start to take shape.
Painful? Yes.
Worth it? Also yes.

## 🏢 Rolling out Microsoft Places
Somewhere in the middle of that chaos, I’ve also been delivering a Microsoft Places deployment.
It’s one of those technologies that feels simple on the surface but has a surprising amount of depth once you start shaping it around how an organisation actually works.
Seeing it come together has been great — it’s nice delivering something that genuinely helps people coordinate and collaborate in the real world.

## 🎲 Board games to keep my brain alive
Outside of work, I managed to squeeze in a bit of gaming time.
This week’s picks were:

Gloomhaven: Buttons & Bugs — surprisingly deep for something so compact.
Buttons and Bugs — small footprint, big decisions, exactly what my brain needed.

There’s something magical about winding down with a game that makes you think just enough without feeling like more work.

## ☕ A good balance
All in all, it’s been a pretty solid week: learning new things, deploying complicated security tech, shipping something useful with Microsoft Places, and unwinding with some dungeon‑crawling cardboard chaos.
If the rest of the year is anything like this week, I’m good with that.
